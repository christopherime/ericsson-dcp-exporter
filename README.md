- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) current (was dev with 1.19, didn't test with other versions)
- config.yaml file (see [config.yaml](src/config.example.yaml) for an example)

### config.yaml

```yaml
# subToWatch is a list of subscription to watch
subToWatch:
  - "subreddit1"
  - "subreddit2"
  - "subreddit3"
```

## Database

Sims value are store in a database with the following structure:

| Column | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Subscription Package Name as string | Sim Imsi value as string |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | -- |
| USERAUTH | base64 encode of the `username:password` | N/A |
| URL | URL of the DCP API in format `https://my-website.com`, no need for the `wsdl` part | N/A |
| SUBPACKAGE | Default subscription package ID to lookup for. For multiple package to watch, use the config.yaml | N/A |
| MAXSIMS | Maximum number of SIMs to watch. If the number of SIMs is higher than this value, the exporter will not watch them | 2000 |

## Metrics

### DCP

| Metric | type | Description | labels | value | implemented |
| --- | --- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| api_status | gauge | API status as a boolean value (1 = true, 0 = false) | N/A | bool | ✅ |
| dcp_scrape_duration_seconds | gauge | Duration for the exporter to go through all it's main function (not counting go routine) | N/A | int | ✅ |
| dcp_scrape_error | gauge | Whether the last scrape of metrics from the DCP resulted in an error (0 for error, 1 for success) | N/A | bool | ✅ |

### sim inventory

| Metric | type | Description | labels | value | implemented |
| --- | --- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| sim_volume | gauge | Number of sim cards in the system | N/A | int | ❌ |
| sim_inventory_status | gauge | Number of SIMs in inventory by status. | status | int | ❌ |
| sim_inventory_subscription | gauge | Number of SIMs in inventory by subscription. | subscription | int | ❌ |

### sim details

| Metric | type | Description | labels | value | implemented |
| --- | --- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| sim_details | gauge | Detail information about a specific SIM |  subscription, name, IMSI, MSISDN, ICCID, IMEI_D, IMEI_A | status | ❌ |
| sim_comsumption_30d | gauge | SIM comsumption the last 30d, will be present only if the SIM status is Active | subscription, name, ICCD | comsumption | ❌ |
| sim_comsumption_7d | gauge | SIM comsumption for the last 7d, will be present only if the SIM status is Active | subscription, name, ICCD | comsumption | ❌ |
| sim_comsumption_24h | gauge | SIM comsumption for the last 24h, will be present only if the SIM status is Active | subscription, name, ICCD | comsumption | ❌ |

For these metrics, `status` stated in the value field corresponds to the following:

| status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | ACTIVE |
| 1 | INACTIVE |
| 2 | SUSPENDED |
| 3 | DELETED |

## Labels

| Label | Description | Values detail | metric applied |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| status | SIM status | STRING =  ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED, DELETED | sim_inventory_status |
| subscription | ID of the subscription that the SIM is link to | STRING (with _ as separator)  | sim_inventory_subscription |
| name | Name of the SIM | STRING | sim_details |
| IMSI | IMSI of the SIM | STRING | sim_details |
| MSISDN | MSISDN of the SIM | STRING | sim_details |
| ICCID | ICCID of the SIM | STRING | sim_details |
| IMEI_D | IMEI Dectected on the SIM | STRING | sim_details |
| IMEI_A | IMEI Attributed for the SIM | STRING | sim_details |
